mods_since_analyze Install
==========================

To install mods_since_analyze, you should untar the log_functions tarball
anywhere you want.

You'll need to compile it. Do the usual "make && make install".

Then you need to install it on the PostgreSQL database. Depending on your
PostgreSQL release, you can do it in two ways:

  * CREATE EXTENSION mods_since_analyze;
  * psql -i mods_since_analyze.sql db

It will install a function called pg_stat_get_mod_since_analyze(), which takes
one parameter, the OID of the table for which you want the statistic since
last ANALYZE.
